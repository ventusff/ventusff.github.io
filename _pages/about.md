I am an undergraduate in [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an_Jiaotong_University), currently taking internship in Huawei Technologies Application Lab.

My life goal is to make AI that trully understands this world and its rich scientific laws, and let AI aid us human race to think, to innovate, to research and to create, and boost mankind's voyage to the wide sea of stars someday.

My current research interest lies in 3D scene understanding, representation learning and decision making of indoor robots.
