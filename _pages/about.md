I am an undergraduate in [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an_Jiaotong_University), currently taking internship in Huawei Technologies Application Lab.

My research interest lies in 3D scene understanding, representation learning and decision making.   
My life goal is to make AI that trully understands this world and let AI aid us human race to explore the sea of stars.
